I am a Master's student in Cybersecurity at [Universit채t des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), with a deep interest in **usable security**, **human factors in security**, and the **security of machine learning models**.

My academic journey began at [Mehran University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.muet.edu.pk/), where I graduated as the **1st position holder** in my batch with a Bachelor's in Telecommunication Engineering. My undergraduate thesis focused on leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) for public health screening during the COVID-19 pandemic, under the supervision of [Dr. Zafi Sherhan Syed](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=OLku1akAAAAJ&hl=en).

Currently, I am working as a **Research Assistant** at [ZeMA](https://zema.de/) and as a **Teaching Assistant** for the StatsLab course led by Prof. Dr. Vera Demberg at Universit채t des Saarlandes.
